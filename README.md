# utc-cube-poc-01

Deployment URL: [hortfrancis.github.io/utc-cube-poc-01](https://hortfrancis.github.io/utc-cube-poc-01/)

This web project is a proof-of-concept. 

It demonstrates a 3D animated cube, as the main menu for a company website, with additional pages accessessible via this cube menu and also the secondary menu. The secondary menu acts as global navigation and also a fallback. 

It is made with React, using Tailwind CSS for styling, and additional vanilla CSS for 3D -- no 3D libraries were used. 

The site layout is responsive; it should perform well on any device. 

Deployment is done using GitHub Pages.
